StrategoGame

Project in development

The rules of this game are very simple. 
Every checker which close row, column or diagonal of board gets exactly as many points as the size of filled dimension.

There will be implemented two playing algorithms minmax and minmax with alpa-beta and maybe greedy algorithm or mix both of them
The goal is to let them play agaist each other and check the results, try to optimalize
